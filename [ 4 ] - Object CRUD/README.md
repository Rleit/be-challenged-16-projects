## Description
This challenge is to get you to understand how the create, read , update and delete works. This is a core concept to every app that is interactive not only on software side but also web.  

In this example , expectation is to build a TODO application that can be controlled through console. 

In its core concept , you build a object array where you have title and content for each item and based on object index you will read, update or delete. 

There is no exact example of how you should do it, so it is up to you to decide. But here are few different ways to approach it.

### "Extra credit"
For extra effort you can also try and make it persistent by looking into database solutions like local SQLlite or more established solutions like postgres or not relational databases such as MongoDB (but not their cloud solution, self hosted one)

### Expected outcome
TODO app that you can make a list of TODOs in and order them in priority.
