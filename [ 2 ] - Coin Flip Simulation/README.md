## Description
This challenge is simple. Simulate a coin flip but also calculate probability for the next flip.

### "Extra credit"
Take into account as much true random as possible. Something that programs dont do well is true random. Its considered pseudo random in most cases. Look into ways to create a true random.  

[For example in the random.py documentation it is mentioned as follows](https://docs.python.org/2/library/random.html#random.SystemRandom)

> **Warning** The pseudo-random generators of this module should not be used for security purposes. Use os.urandom() or SystemRandom if you require a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator. 

### Expected outcome
Coin flip results shown in console with probability of next flip being the same.
