## Description
This task is pretty straight forward in its own. Goal is to make an app that has some text on it and a button. In Realpython example guidance they are also going into building a text editor, which if there is time is worth looking into. But I suggest using one of the previous challenges as a "goal".

[Python GUI basic guidance](https://realpython.com/python-gui-tkinter/)

[How to turn python script into an executable](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convert-python-script-to-exe-file/)

### "Extra credit"
Use one of the previous challenges as a way to put something more on the GUI. For example graphical coin flip, unit converter or even a "ToDo list" based on the initial CRUD example

### Expected outcome
A GUI that has some text, a button that does something and that can be launched from an executable and not by .py file.
