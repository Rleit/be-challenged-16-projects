## Description
The idea here is to create basic conversion application. When launched it will ask what you want to convert and into what. At its core , its easy to make one conversion between for example USD to EUR or Farenheit to Celsius. But what is difficult is having the same initial starting point and select which one you want it to be converted into. 

For example you have celsius and you convert it into farenheit, but then you decide to press back and convert the same celsius to kelvin for example. This requires saving the initial data of celsius and allowing it to be converted into others based on selection

### "Extra credit"
Using matrix arrays, it could simplify the conversions.

If desire to make currency conversions more interesting, you can also kind of go ahead of challenges and try to import a public api for currency rates actively. 

### Expected outcome
Conversions between the following

- Celsius, Farenheit, Kelvin
- USD, EUR, YEN
- Volume (Litre, Millilitre, Gallon, Pint)
- Mass (KG , Grams , Tons , just simple metric conversions but can always include imperial ones for complexity)
