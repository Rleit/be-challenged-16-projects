### Info Dump
**How to get github setup on local machine** - This guide focuses on creating a new branch, which isnt wrong and you can pull this repo seperately .But if you want to have all these readme files ready to go, I suggest forking this repository for more straightforward action..

**Most used IDE recently VSCode, also most supported** - There are also others like sublime, Atom , PyCharm for python by IntellJ. Dependant on what you want. But VSCode fastest to launch, get into and customize if needed.
