## Description
Within this challenge you will be expected to build a number guessing game. Program will guess a number for example between 1 - 100 and you will be playing a game of getting it closer

### "Extra credit"
This can also be turned into a GUI based guessing game, when after launching the python program a GUI of the program pops up with a guess box and a box that shows "Hot" or "cold" while guessing closer and closer. This game could also have a highscore based on guesses and how long it took to guess (meaning a timer from start and a counter) . 



### Expected outcome
At minimal , console question "What number am i thinking about ?" and when guessing for example 50 , it would say "Warm, Hot, Cold , Colder , Hotter" etc to get you closer to the number.
